    "From this graph, we can see that the most important predictor among the 5 is bedrooms. For Ridge Regression, the beta estimate of each predictor will converge to zero (but will never reach zero) as lambda increases, the faster it converges to zero, the less important the predictor is. For this case, the most important predictor is bedrooms. The reason why the beta estimate does not reach zero is because Ridge Regression does not drop any predictors, unlike Lasso Regression, which we will observe later on."

Additionally a traveller who wants to pay the lowest possible price for a listing might want to avoid having these features in his prospective housing :\n",

    "There are plenty of listings in 'Belltown' or 'West Queen Anne' and they tend to be expensive.\n",
    "Words like: 'view', 'modern' & 'walk' all frequently appear in the summary of the more expensive listing.\n",
    "Ammenities such as: 'Washer', Dryer', 'Heating', 'Wireless Internet', 'Smoke Detector', 'Free Parking', 'Kid Friendly', 'TV', 'HotTub/Sauna/Pool', 'Gyms' and 'Elevators' are all common among the more expensive listings.\n",
